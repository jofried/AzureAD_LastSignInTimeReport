# AzureAD_LastSignInTimeReport
Using an Azure AD App Registration and the Microsoft Graph API, we can pull the signInActivity of users and extract the value of "lastSignInDateTime". This would allow you to find users who have not signed into their account for a while, and you could determine whether or not the account/user is still active or not.
